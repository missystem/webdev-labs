1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?
By using JOIN we can retrieve data from multiple tables at one time by using related information (column values are the same).
For example, users.id = posts.user_id, so that we can retrieve information from users table and posts table at one time.

2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
To maintain space efficiency and reduce duplicate data.
It is expensive to store information by linking posts to username, first_name or last_name, and will have a lot of duplicate information whenever this user post any new post. 
In addition, foreign keys can help preventing errors and improving the performance of any operation that is pulling data from tables linked by indexed foreign keys.
