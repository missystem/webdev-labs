    a python abstraction that makes communication with databases easier
    (efficient and high-performing database access)
    a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases

2. What is a model?
    Model is a class within the SQLAlchemy project
    Rather than writing SQL directly, interact with SQL Alchemy "models" that issues SQL queries under-the-hood
    Then we are able to create, update, and delete 
3. What is a view?
    A view is like a virtual table, rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database.
