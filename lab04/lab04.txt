1. What is the value of SQLAlchemy?
    Gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL
    A python abstraction that makes communication with databases easier
      (efficient and high-performing database access)
    A library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases

2. What is a model?
    Rather than writing SQL directly, interact with SQLAlchemy "models" that issues 
      SQL queries under-the-hood, then we can create, update, and delete from a 
      data table.
    "
    A feature of SQLAlchemy
    Models provide representations of each data table in the form of Python classes so 
      that you can interact with rows in each table just like you'd interact with any 
      Python class instance.

3. What is a view?
    "
    A feature of Flask RESTful
    Views define which API resources (ie. post, posts, user, users, etc.) are available
      via API as well as which methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) are available 
      for each resource. 
    They also define the functionality that is invoked when each endpoint is requested.
